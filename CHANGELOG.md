## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Preserved Windows unit-test execution in Release/Debug matrix jobs, including existing warning behavior when `EnvyTests.exe` is missing for a platform/configuration.
- Restored build artifact uploads for Release/Debug matrix outputs (Envy exe/pdb, HashLib dll/pdb where available, Services and Plugins DLLs).
- Preserved coverage capability via `Coverage (Debug x64)` while gating it to schedule/manual/relevant C++ PR contexts to keep normal PR checks fast.
- Optimized GitHub Actions into fast PR checks and heavy advisory/full-build checks with explicit path-filter routing for docs-only, markdown-only, Remote JS-only, and C++/build-impacting changes.
- Stabilized authoritative Windows CI by requiring MSVC `v145` with explicit diagnostics (VS path, MSBuild version, VC tools path/version, ATL/MFC presence) and clear fail-fast behavior without `v143` fallback.
- Reduced unnecessary heavy tool installation by removing repeated Visual Studio Build Tools installation from standard CI jobs and improving safe NuGet/npm caching usage.
- Optimized CI workflows to separate fast PR checks from heavy Windows builds, add path-based routing (docs-only and Remote JS-only behavior), and add safe NuGet/npm caching.
- Enforced authoritative Windows build policy by explicitly requiring MSVC PlatformToolset `v145`, adding toolset detection, and failing clearly when `v145` is unavailable (no silent `v143` fallback).
- Updated `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` to reflect current `develop` repository hygiene status, including branch posture (`develop` default, `main` behind), CI gate maturity guidance, and Dependabot label prerequisites (`ci`, `dependencies`).
- Clarified dependency register status as **not complete** while `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` is absent on `develop`.
- Rewrote root `README.md` to reflect current repository layout, build entry points, and documentation map.
- Updated `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to align with risk-based review and validation reporting.
- **Full protocol comparison audit** - Comprehensive comparison against reference implementations (eMule, aMule, libtorrent, qBittorrent, Transmission)
  - Updated `docs/10_dev/status.md` with detailed feature matrices for all protocol areas
  - Updated `docs/10_dev/roadmap.md` with evidence-based phases and accurate TODO items


### Security
- Kad publish packet builder now uses bounded keyword copying in `KadProtocol::CreatePublishRequest` (`memcpy` + explicit null terminator) and added null/size guards for `buffer`, `targetId`, and `keyword` before writes, preserving existing packet wire format and 255-byte keyword limit.
- Remote UI hardening completed for CRITICAL/HIGH audit findings: cryptographically secure CSRF tokens, centralized token handling, DOMPurify-backed sanitization for dynamic HTML, redirect allowlist enforcement, and boundary API input validation with typed errors.
- CSP tightened for modern Remote pages by removing `'unsafe-inline'` and migrating inline handlers/styles/scripts to external assets (`modern-page-handlers.js`, `modern-inline.css`).
- Rate limiter config-path bug fixed (`windowMs`/`maxRequests` now sourced from the correct object path) with regression test coverage.
- Added JavaScript security regression suite in `Remote/tests` and integrated into `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`.


### Added
- IPv6 Phase 0 planning docs: created `docs/ipv6/SCOPE.md` (file impact inventory + migration scope) and `docs/ipv6/PLAN.md` (living phased dual-stack plan, risks, rollback).
- Documentation governance baseline: added comprehensive audit reports under `docs/audit/` (architecture, security, code quality, dependency, performance).
- New canonical docs: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, and living `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.
- GitHub community/automation configuration: Markdown issue templates, `security.yml` (secret scanning), `CODEOWNERS`, and Dependabot configuration for GitHub Actions.
- Agent guidance files: root `CLAUDE.md`, root `AGENTS.md`, and refreshed `.cursor/rules/README.md`.

### Added
- **ED2K SecureID version fix** - Changed `ED2K_VERSION_SECUREID` from 0 to 3 in `EDPacket.h`; peers now correctly see Envy as supporting SecureID
- **ED2K SourceEx2 implementation** (0x83/0x84) - `OnSourceRequest2()`/`OnSourceAnswer2()` handlers; `DownloadTransferED2K` prefers SourceEx2 when peer supports it
- **Kademlia FIND_VALUE + PUBLISH** - DHT search and publish with in-memory value storage, handlers for opcodes 0x33-0x49, search/publish initiation methods
- **BitTorrent MSE/PE encryption** (`BTCrypto.h/cpp`) - DH key exchange (768-bit), RC4 stream encryption, MSE handshake state machine, integrated into `CBTClient`; new `Settings.BitTorrent.Encryption` setting (default: prefer)

  - CI workflow runs tests automatically after Release and Debug builds
  - Tests exposed a SHA-256 implementation bug (buffer position calculation in `Add()`)
- **SHA-256 fix** - Corrected buffer position and block reset in `HashLib/SHA256.cpp::Add()`
  - Buffer position is now computed from the byte count before updating `m_nCount`
  - Reset `bufferPos` to 0 after processing a full block
- **SHA-256 full fix** - All unit tests now pass
  - Fixed 64-bit length encoding in `Finish()`: use `bitLength` directly for big-endian bytes (was wrongly placing length in high byte)
  - Message schedule now uses FIPS 180-4 lowercase σ1 (`sigma1`) instead of Σ1 (`Sigma1`) in all three places (Add + Finish)
- **Unit test expansion** - Added 2 HashLib tests (13 total)
  - SHA-256: NIST-style vector for single-byte "a"; block-boundary test (64-byte input in one go vs two 32-byte chunks)
- **CI code coverage** - Code coverage job in `.github/workflows/build.yml`
  - Runs after Debug build (x64); uses OpenCppCoverage on EnvyTests.exe
  - Scopes coverage to `HashLib` and `tests`; exports Cobertura XML and HTML report
