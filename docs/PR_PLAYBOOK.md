# PR Playbook

Use this playbook to keep PRs small, reviewable, and operationally safe.

## Global Expectations (All PR Types)

- One logical change area per PR.
- Report:
  - testing performed
  - testing not performed
  - environment limitations
- Never silently remove tests, coverage, workflows, docs, artifacts, or legacy files.
- Update under `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible changes.
- Update durable docs only when behavior, setup, architecture, security, or
  release procedures change (see `AGENTS.md` documentation policy).
- Use GitHub Issues and PR descriptions for shared task status; optional
  personal session notes may go in `.local/` (gitignored).

## Git sync

Use `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` as the canonical source for the linear-history workflow and exact `git fetch` / `git rebase origin/develop` / `git push --force-with-lease` commands.

## Documentation PR Checklist

### Testing expectations
- Verify Markdown renders cleanly in GitHub preview.
- Run link validation tooling if available.

### Documentation expectations
- Ensure canonical doc references are updated.
- Avoid duplicate status blocks; link to canonical source.

### Risk review expectations
- Confirm no workflow/runtime behavior changes were introduced accidentally.

## CI PR Checklist

### Testing expectations
- Validate changed workflows/jobs with at least one representative run.
- Capture required vs advisory check impact.

### Documentation expectations
- Update build/CI sections in relevant durable docs (`README.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`, plan docs).

### Risk review expectations
- Preserve validation capability unless intentionally moved and documented.
- Call out branch protection and merge-gate implications.

## Security PR Checklist

### Testing expectations
- Add/adjust regression tests where feasible.
- Validate both positive and malformed input cases.

### Documentation expectations
- Update security audit/tracker references.
- Record remaining risk and follow-up actions.

### Risk review expectations
- Explicitly list compatibility and performance implications.
- Prefer audit-first approach for high-risk areas.

## Protocol PR Checklist

### Testing expectations
- Run protocol-specific unit/integration checks available in scope.
- Document wire-level verification strategy.

### Documentation expectations
- Update protocol status and roadmap docs.
- Add compatibility notes for any behavior-facing changes.

### Risk review expectations
- Preserve wire compatibility unless explicitly documented.
- Identify interop risk with reference clients.

## Refactor PR Checklist

### Testing expectations
- Run nearest test/build suite for touched components.
- Report unchanged behavior intent and verification depth.

### Documentation expectations
- Update plan/tracker/changelog if scope or sequencing changes.

### Risk review expectations
- Avoid broad refactors without explicit approved scope.
- Highlight rollback strategy for risky changes.
